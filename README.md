#NN Assembly Studio

NN Assembly Studio is an idea I wanted to implement a long time ago.

It’s an app that lets you build neural network architectures by dragging, dropping and connecting built-in or custom components.
You can create, save, and modify custom components to use in future projects.
The designed network can be converted into its corresponding PyTorch code.

The project is less than 10% complete due to some design challenges that I’m still working on, and it’s currently postponed.

steps to run the project

- clone the project
- install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run the main.py file
